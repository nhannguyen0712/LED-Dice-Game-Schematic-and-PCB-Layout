# LED-Dice-Game-Schematic-and-PCB-Layout
This project designs an LED dice game using an Atmega328 microcontroller. It generates random numbers and controls LEDs to simulate a dice roll. The PCB layout ensures proper component integration and smooth LED operation, following design and electrical rules to maintain signal integrity and minimize interference.
